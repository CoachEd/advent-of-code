These numbers appear to be the first 20 terms of an arithmetic sequence. In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between each term and the previous term is constant. In this sequence, the common difference is 11, since the difference between each term and the previous term is 11. For example, the difference between 11 and 2 is 9, the difference between 25 and 11 is 14, and so on.

1: [3, 11, 19, 22, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 33, 37, 39, 40, 44, 46, 49, 51, 57, 58]
These numbers also appear to be part of an arithmetic sequence, although it is not immediately clear what the common difference is. To find the common difference, we can subtract each number from the previous number in the sequence. For example, the difference between 11 and 3 is 8, the difference between 19 and 11 is 8, and so on. It looks like the common difference in this sequence is 8.
